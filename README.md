matplotconf
=============

<p>A repository of custom matplotlib settings. Make sure matsettings.py is at the same level as your code and simply import in to your script and you're good to go! </p>
<br><p>Then edit the file to customise your matplotlib any way you like. This is a simpler way to customise matplotlib without having to edit the .matplotlibrc file.</p>

```python
import matsettings
```
